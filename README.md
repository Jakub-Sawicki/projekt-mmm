# Numerical Methods Project

A Python-based simulation of dynamic systems using numerical integration techniques. This application provides a GUI for entering parameters and comparing results of two popular methods: Euler and Runge-Kutta 4th order. Originally developed for coursework in system modeling and simulation.

## Simulation Overview

- Simulates physical systems governed by differential equations
- Choose between Euler and Runge-Kutta 4th order methods
- Real-time visualization using matplotlib
- User-friendly GUI built with tkinter

## Features

- Euler method integration
- Runge-Kutta 4th order method
- GUI for entering initial conditions
- Live plot display of simulation results
- Separated parameter logic for easier editing

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
